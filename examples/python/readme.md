## üéØ Current Demos

### üé¨ [AI Movie Production](../movie-production/README.md)
**Requirements**: AWS Account with Amazon Bedrock access (Claude models enabled)

Bring your movie ideas to life with this AI-powered production assistant. Describe your movie concept, select a genre and target audience, and let the system create a comprehensive script outline and recommend actors for the main roles based on real-time research.

### ‚úàÔ∏è [AI Travel Planner](../travel-planner/README.md)
**Requirements**: Anthropic API Key

Enter your destination and travel duration, and the system will research attractions, accommodations, and activities in real-time to create a personalized, day-by-day itinerary based on your preferences.

### üí≥ [Payment Processing] (../payment-processing/README.md)
**Requirements**: AWS Account with Amazon Bedrock access (Claude models enabled)

An application that processes payments for gig workers using a multi-agent orchestration system. The system performs payout request validation, fraud detection, and payment processing through a chain of specialized agents with deterministic tool usage.
