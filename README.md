<br /><br />

1. The process begins with user input, which is analyzed by a Classifier.
2. The Classifier leverages both Agents' Characteristics and Agents' Conversation history to select the most appropriate agent for the task.
3. Once an agent is selected, it processes the user input.
4. The orchestrator then saves the conversation, updating the Agents' Conversation history, before delivering the response back to the user.


## ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awslabs/multi-agent-orchestrator/main/img/new.png) Introducing SupervisorAgent: Agents Coordination

The Multi-Agent Orchestrator now includes a powerful new SupervisorAgent that enables sophisticated team coordination between multiple specialized agents. This new component implements a "agent-as-tools" architecture, allowing a lead agent to coordinate a team of specialized agents in parallel, maintaining context and delivering coherent responses.

![SupervisorAgent flow diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awslabs/multi-agent-orchestrator/main/img/flow-supervisor.jpg)

Key capabilities:
- 🤝 **Team Coordination** - Coordonate multiple specialized agents working together on complex tasks
- ⚡ **Parallel Processing** - Execute multiple agent queries simultaneously
- 🧠 **Smart Context Management** - Maintain conversation history across all team members
- 🔄 **Dynamic Delegation** - Intelligently distribute subtasks to appropriate team members
- 🤖 **Agent Compatibility** - Works with all agent types (Bedrock, Anthropic, Lex, etc.)

The SupervisorAgent can be used in two powerful ways:
1. **Direct Usage** - Call it directly when you need dedicated team coordination for specific tasks
2. **Classifier Integration** - Add it as an agent within the classifier to build complex hierarchical systems with multiple specialized teams

Here are just a few examples where this agent can be used:
- Customer Support Teams with specialized sub-teams
- AI Movie Production Studios
- Travel Planning Services
- Product Development Teams
- Healthcare Coordination Systems

))
orchestrator.add_agent(health_agent)

async def main():
    # Example usage
    response = await orchestrator.route_request(
        "What is AWS Lambda?",
        'user123',
        'session456',
        {},
        True
    )

    # Handle the response (streaming or non-streaming)
    if response.streaming:
        print("\n** RESPONSE STREAMING ** \n")
        # Send metadata immediately
        print(f"> Agent ID: {response.metadata.agent_id}")
        print(f"> Agent Name: {response.metadata.agent_name}")
        print(f"> User Input: {response.metadata.user_input}")
        print(f"> User ID: {response.metadata.user_id}")
        print(f"> Session ID: {response.metadata.session_id}")
        print(f"> Additional Parameters: {response.metadata.additional_params}")
        print("\n> Response: ")

        # Stream the content
        async for chunk in response.output:
            async for chunk in response.output:
              if isinstance(chunk, AgentStreamResponse):
                  print(chunk.text, end='', flush=True)
              else:
                  print(f"Received unexpected chunk type: {type(chunk)}", file=sys.stderr)

    else:
        # Handle non-streaming response (AgentProcessingResult)
        print("\n** RESPONSE ** \n")
        print(f"> Agent ID: {response.metadata.agent_id}")
        print(f"> Agent Name: {response.metadata.agent_name}")
        print(f"> User Input: {response.metadata.user_input}")
        print(f"> User ID: {response.metadata.user_id}")
        print(f"> Session ID: {response.metadata.session_id}")
        print(f"> Additional Parameters: {response.metadata.additional_params}")
        print(f"\n> Response: {response.output.content}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  asyncio.run(main())
```

These examples showcase:
1. The use of a Bedrock LLM Agent with Converse API support, allowing for multi-turn conversations.
2. Integration of a Lex Bot Agent for specialized tasks (in this case, travel-related queries).
